			<section>
				<h1>Why?</h1>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>It's complicated</h1>
				<p>Front end applications are growing and including more and more JavaScript</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>jQuery doesn't cut it anymore</h1>
				<p>
					Making all your UI changes using jQuery or direct DOM manipulation is painful, hard to test and compose.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Still, why React and not others?</h1>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Less opinions</h1>
				<p>React is an UI frameworks, everything else comes from other libraries and frameworks that you decide to use.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Fast</h1>
				<p>Only components that had a state change will be re-rendered, everything else stays the same.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>(Mostly) plain JavaScript</h1>
				<p>
					There aren't special objects or flows you need to follow, everything is a JS object and you can build them any way you'd
					like.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Still, YMMV</h1>
				<p>
					There's no such thing as the perfect framework, give the others a try and figure out what works best for you and your needs.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>What do you need to get started?</h1>
				<p>
					Latest nodejs install (currently 6.7.0)
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>After installing node, in a command line:</h1>
				<pre>
					<code data-trim class="shell">
$ npm install -g create-react-app
$ create-react-app libertyjs-todo
					</code>
				</pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Do I <strong>have</strong> to use Nodejs?</h1>
				<p>
					Yes, but only for development, you can produce a standalone build and integrate it to your app or favorite framework.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Let's walk over the files we have</h1>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>App.js</li>
						<li>index.js</li>
						<li>index.html</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Components are the heart of your React app</h1>
				<p>
					They're the main point of interaction between the user and the actions your app implements. They're a mix of controllers
					and views if you're used to MVC.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>What kind of sorcery is this code?</h1>
				<p>
					To make your life easier, most React development is done using ES6 syntax and a bunch of other niceties (the JSX syntax that
					allows you to enter HTML directly into JavaScript code).
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>What if I don't like it?</h1>
				<p>
					You can definitely write your apps using only browser compatible JavaScript but the pain of doing so might not be worth the
					trouble.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Our first component!</h1>
				<p>TodoItem.js</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Then we integrate it in App.js</h1>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Now let's get some state in place</h1>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>props</li>
						<li>getInitialState</li>
						<li>state</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Props!</h1>
				<p>
					Immutable properties of your component, when they change, a new component is rendered 
					instead of reusing the existing one</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>propTypes</h1>
				<p>
					Basic type and presence validation for your props, customizable 
					to perform other types of validation.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>getInitialState</h1>
				<p>
					Setup method to fill in your component with the basic state 
					it needs to be rendered for the first time. Must return an 
					object.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>state</h1>
				<p>
					Actual state that your component holds, gets changed through the 
					setState method and makes a component be re-rendered.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Creating the form component</h1>
				<p>
					Now that we can show tasks, it's time to be able to add them!
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Event handlers</h1>
				<p>
					All React HTML components allow you to add event handlers to them, 
					just like you would in plain HTML and JavaScript, the only difference
					is that they're included right at the component markup and handlers
					are camel cased so <em>onChange</em> instead of <em>onchange</em>.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Function name on event handler</h1>
				<pre>
					<code data-trim class="jsx">
<input
value={this.state.text}
onChange={this.handleTextChange}/>
					</code>
				</pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>No <em>()</em> on event handlers!</h1>
				<p>
					You don't want to call the function, you want to 
					provide a callback as a property so the component can call it.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>But wait, where is this state going?</h1>
				<p>
					We have to bubble the task insert event up so we need a callback 
					prop at the form to notify someone else we need to insert a new task.
				</p>
